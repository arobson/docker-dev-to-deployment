# How to view the slides

Just open a browser and point it to the index.html file in the slides directory. ex: file:///git/talks/docker-dev-to-deployment/slides/index.html

# Code

There's a seperate readme in the node-app which provides command line examples for how to package the app, build the docker image and start a container based on the image.

Hope it helps!
